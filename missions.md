## Gathering Resources

In every game of Survivors, the primary goal is to find resources and get out alive. As such the following conditions for Victory Points apply to every mission:

- 3 Victory Points for every Resource secured.
- 2 Victory Points if every member of your group survived.
- -1 Victory Point for every member of your group that was killed.

## Selecting a Mission

Players can either agree which mission they wish to play or roll a d6 to decide randomly.

1. Shopping Spree
2. The Forest
3. Cabin in the Woods
4. Secure Compound
5. The Highway
6. Rail Yard

## Shopping Spree

Once-busy streets now lie abandoned, strewn with the wreckage of the initial outbreak. The narrow alleys and darkened doorways make it hard to spot the undead before they get too close - but the shelves still lay full, there is more than enough here if you can keep your eyes peeled and work fast.

#### Setup

Set up your table with several buildings, ideally depicting an abandoned city street or other shopping area, with abandoned cars between them. You could also set this mission up as the interior of a large supermarket with rows of shelves.

#### Zombies

Players should roll-off then alternate placing 2 Zombie Entry Points each around the outside of the table, with at least 9 inches between them. They should then both place 2 Entry Points within the battlefield, ideally next to the doors of buildings, cars, or the entryway to alleys. These must be at least 6 inches from any other Zombie Entry Point.

Both players then roll a D6 each and alternate placing that many zombies on the board at least 3 inches from any other Zombie.

#### Entry Points

The player that lost the roll-off for placing Zombies should pick a table edge and place their entry point either in the center of it or in one of the corners. The other player takes the opposite table edge and does the same.

#### Resources

Starting with the player that lost the roll-off for placing Zombies, both players should place 3 Resource objectives. Each objective must be at least 9 inches from a table edge and 6 inches from another Resource objective.
