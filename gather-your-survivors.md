# Gather your Survivors

---

## Survivor Groups

To create your group of Survivors you choose models from the list below, paying for the model and any weapon or equipment up to a limit of 100 points. You will notice there are restrictions on how many of a given model you may include in your group, for example you must always include exactly 1 Leader model.

When buying equipment, weapons, or upgrades you may not spend more on upgrades than the cost of the model.
