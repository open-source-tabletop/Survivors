# Survivors

> "When there's no more room in hell the dead will walk the earth"

It's the **Zombie Apocalypse** and your only goal now is to **survive**! You and your small band of survivors must scavenge food, medicine, and ammo amongst the wreckage of civilization, but the **walking dead** are not the only threat you need to be aware of. Other groups of survivors will stop at nothing to get those supplies before you, and there's definitely not enough to go around. 

Fighting will draw the hordes of zombies but failing to get what you need is as much a death sentence.

# Playing Survivors

## Zombies

The world of survivors is overrun with the walking dead, and there are several rules that govern their actions on the battlefield. The threat of zombie attacks increases over time and careless actions from a player can see them being surrounded and overwhelmed quickly.

### Zombie Threat Level

Throughout the course of a game the disturbance caused by players actions draws more and more zombies to the conflict area.

Threat Level is simply a number between 1 and 6: 1 being low threat and 6 being overrun by hordes of zombies, players should use a dice or counter to track this throughout the game. Threat Level is used any time players cause a disturbance, explained below, to determine if there will be any zombie activity.

### Disturbance Rolls

At the end of each model's activations they make 1 to 6 disturbance rolls. They roll a d6 and must roll higher than the current Threat Level, each failure triggers Zombie Activity. Models must make one disturbance roll every activation but will make additional rolls for the following:

- Performing 3 or more actions
- Making an attack action, some weapons cause additional disturbance rolls
- Moving within 6 inches of a zombie or zombie entry point
- Moving within 6 inches of more than one zombie

### Zombie Models

Zombie models work like any other model, having attributes, performing actions, etc. However they activate under specific circumstances detailed below, and have no owning player. Any time a model attacks a zombie the opposing player makes the defence and counter rolls.

### Zombie Entry Points

The zombies have their own entry points, some scattered around the table edge, while others are placed on the battoefield, at building doorways and so on. Zombies are deployed at these entry points as explained below.

### Zombie Activity

For each failed disturbance roll a player makes, the opposing player gets to activate a zombie, before activating one of their own models (meaning careful players can use the zombies in a way that suits them).

The player chooses a zombie within 12 inches of the model that caused the disturbance, if there are no Zombies within 12 inches the player instead places a number of new zombies, equal to the current Threat Level, within 3 inches of any zombie entry point on the battlefield.

If a player activates a zombie it performs a move action then an attack action following these guidelines in order:

- If the zombie is able to move within 1 inch of a non-zombie model it must do so towards the nearest valid model.
- If the Zombie cannot reach 1 inch of a non-zombie model it moves its full movement and must finish closer to the model that caused the disturbance.
- If a zombie was activated but the model there is no model that caused the disturbance, either because the zombie was activated separately or the disturbing model has been killed then they can be moved freely.
- If a zombie can attack a model it does so, if there are multiple valid targets the model that caused the disturbance takes priority, otherwise the controlling player can choose.
- Zombies cannot climb, making roof tops some of the safest places to be, just be careful not to get trapped.

When both players have finished activating all of their own models they then alternate selecting zombies to activate following these rules.
