## Threat Level

Throughout the course of a game the disturbance caused by players actions draws more and more zombies to the conflict area. Threat Level is represented as a number between 1 and 6, players should use a dice or counter to track this throughout the game. Threat Level is used any time players cause a disturbance, explained below, to determine if there will be any zombie activity.

## Disturbance Rolls

At the end of each model's activations they must make one or more disturbance rolls. A disturbance roll is a d6 which must roll higher than the current Threat Level, if it fails to do so this triggers Zombie Activity.
