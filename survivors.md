# Playing Survivors

## Threat Level

Throughout the course of a game the disturbance caused by players actions draws more and more zombies to the conflict area. Threat Level is represented as a number between 1 and 6, players should use a dice or counter to track this throughout the game. Threat Level is used any time players cause a disturbance, explained below, to determine if there will be any zombie activity.

## Disturbance Rolls

At the end of each model's activations they must make one or more disturbance rolls. A disturbance roll is a d6 which must roll higher than the current Threat Level, if it fails to do so this triggers Zombie Activity.

## Zombies

In Survivors, Zombies are able to move and attack like any other unit, but how they activate and their choice of actions is dictated by the Zombie Activity rules.

### Zombie Entry Points

Most missions will require you to place a number of Zombies on the battlefield before starting Round 1, however, more zombies will show up throughout the game. Zombie Entry Points are also placed around the battlefield both along table edges and within the battlefield itself. 

### Zombie Activity

Any time a player fails a disturbance roll, the other player must activate a zombie for each failed disturbance roll before activating one of their own models. They must choose the closest possible zombie to the model that caused the disturbance that still has Command Points, if there are no valid zombies within 12 inches of the model, but there is a Zombie Entry Point then the player must place a number of Zombies within 3 inches of that entry point equal to the threat level instead of activating a zombie. When activating a Zombie it will make a move action then an attack action following these rules:

- If the Zombie is able to move within 1 inch of a non-zombie model it must do so towards the nearest valid model.
- If the Zombie cannot reach 1 inch of a non-zombie model it moves towards the model that caused the disturbance using it's full movement.
- If a zombie was activated but the model there is no model that caused the disturbance, either because the zombie was activated separately or the disturbing model has been killed then they move towards the nearest visible non zombie model.

When both players have finished activating all of their models they then alternate selecting zombies to activate.
