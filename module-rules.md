# Survivors Rules

---

## Playing Survivors

This game requires a battlefield around **3ft by 3ft**, or something with a similar area and each game lasts for **6 rounds**. The game can be played with two players, each controlling a band of up to 10 characters, with a horde of up to 40 zombies that are alternately controlled by the players. Alternatively the game can be played with one band of survivors and the zombies either being controlled by a second player or governed by some rules for their actions.

## Zombies

The world of survivors is overrun with the walking dead, and there are several rules that govern their actions on the battlefield. The threat of zombie attacks increases over time and careless actions from a player can see them being surrounded and overwhelmed quickly. The standard way to play Survivors is detailed below, where both players control their own warband and the zombies, rules for 1 player vs zombies are given in a separate section.

### Zombie Threat Level

Throughout the course of a game the disturbance caused by players actions draws more and more zombies to the conflict area. Threat Level is simply a number between 1 and 6: 1 being low threat and 6 being overrun by hordes of zombies, players should use a dice or counter to track this throughout the game. Threat Level is used any time players cause a disturbance, explained below, to determine if there will be any zombie activity.

**Any time a player fails 3 disturbance rolls in one go, shown below, the threat level increases up to a maximum of 6.**

### Disturbance Rolls

At the end of every survivor model's activation the controlling player will make disturbance rolls. A disturbance roll is a d6 that must roll higher than the current Threat Level, every failed roll triggers Zombie Activity. Players always make at least one disturbance roll after every activation but will make additional rolls for the following:

- Performing 3 or more actions.
- Making an attack action (some weapons cause 2 disturbance rolls).
- Moving within 6 inches of a zombie or zombie entry point.
- Moving within 6 inches of more than one zombie, this is in addition to the above.

### Zombie Models

Zombie models work a lot like any other model, having attributes, performing actions, etc. However they activate under specific circumstances detailed below, and have no owning player. Any time a model attacks a zombie the opposing player makes the defence and counter rolls.

### Zombie Entry Points

The zombies have their own entry points, some scattered around the table edge, while others are placed on the battoefield, at building doorways and so on. Zombies are deployed at these entry points as explained below.

### Zombie Activity

For each failed disturbance roll a player makes, the opposing player must activate every zombie within 12 inches of the model that caused the disturbance, before activating one of their own models if they have any remaining with command points (meaning careful players can use the zombies in a way that suits them). In addition, every time a player failes any disturbance rolls, they must place one new zombie at any of the zombie entry points they choose.

Some of the zombie stats are dependant on the current threat level, shown in their attributes as Z. This value is half the current Threat Level rounded up, so Threat Level 1 and 2 has a Z value of 1, 3 and 4 has a Z value of 2 and so on.

If a player activates a zombie it performs a move action then an attack action following these guidelines in order:

1. If the zombie is able to move within 1 inch of a non-zombie model it must do so towards the nearest valid model.
2. If the zombie cannot reach 1 inch of a non-zombie model it moves its full movement and must finish closer to the model that caused the disturbance.
3. If a zombie was activated but there is no model that caused the disturbance, either because the zombie was activated by another rule or the disturbing model has been killed then they can be moved freely.
4. If a zombie can attack a model it does so, if there are multiple valid targets the model that caused the disturbance takes priority, otherwise the controlling player can choose.
5. zombies cannot climb, making raised areas some of the safest places to be, just be careful not to get trapped.
